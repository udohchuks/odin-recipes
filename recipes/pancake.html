        <!--

        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Break the eggs into a wide bowl, add the melted butter and sugar; 
                Cream(mix) together using a whisk or wooden spatula.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Add the minced onions, pepper, salt, nutmeg and the milk. Whisk Thoroughly.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Gradually add the flour and keep on whisking. The mixture would begin to thicken and look lumpy.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Add more milk or water if  the pancake batter is too thick and 
                continue stirring until the pancake batter is smooth with a runny consistency.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Place a little oil on a pan (preferable a non-stick pan), 
                spread the oil with a brush to grease the whole surface and heat up until hot.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Using a ladle(soup spoon), scoop up some of the pancake batter and pour into the hot pan. 
                Gently tilt the pan, so that the batter can evenly coat the surface of the pan.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Cook one side of the pancake for a few seconds, then flip over and cook the other side.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Repeat this process for the remaining pancake batter. Serve and Enjoy!
