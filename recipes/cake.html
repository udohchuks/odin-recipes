    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        simple vanilla cake recipe is the perfect introductory cake for beginners, 
        as well as a versatile standby for more experienced bakers to have on hand.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>175g (6oz) margarine or softened butter</li>
        <li>175g (6oz) caster sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>175g (6oz) self-raising flour, sifted</li>
        <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            Heat the oven to 180Â°C (gas mark 4). 
            Lightly grease an 18cm (7in) round cake tin with a little 
            extra butter or margarine and cut a piece of greaseproof 
            paper or non-stick baking parchment to fit the base 
            of the tin.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Put all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl and 
            beat with a wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer for 1 minute, 
            or until just combined. It's important not to beat the 
            batter too much - just long enough to make it smooth.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin, smooth the 
            top and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 
            about 45-50 minutes. The cake is cooked when it looks well 
            risen and golden; the top should spring back when 
            lightly touched with a fingertip. Another test is to insert 
            a skewer into the centre of the cake - it should come out clean.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Let the cake sit in the tin for 5 minutes, 
            then gently run a knife around the edge and turn it out 
            onto a wire rack to cool. Serve dusted with icing sugar.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
