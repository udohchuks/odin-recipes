        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Jollof rice is not considered a side, but the main dish. 
            It is often paired with beef, chicken, goat, and fish (fried, grilled, or stewed), or eggs (boiled, fried, or scrambled).
            In Nigeria, it is served with a salad that resembles an amped-up version of coleslaw. 
            It may also be accompanied by moinmoin, a steamed dish made with skinned, pureed black-eyed beans 
            wrapped in the moinmoin leaves that give it its name, or dodoâ€”fried, ripe plantains. 
            At least one or more of these accompaniments is considered standard.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                For the Stew Base: In a blender jar, combine tomatoes, 
                red pepper, onion, Scotch bonnet or habanero, 
                and stock. Blend until a smooth puree forms, about 2 minutes. 
                This will yield just shy of 5 cups (1.18L)
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Transfer the stew base to a 3-quart saucier or saucepan, 
                cover partially with a lid to contain splatter, and 
                bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low
                and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom occasionally, until 
                reduced by half (roughly about 2 1/2 cups; 590ml), about 30 minutes. 
                Remove from heat and set aside.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                For the Jollof Rice: In a 4- or 5-quart pot or Dutch oven, 
                heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium heat until shimmering. 
                Add half the sliced onion along with the bay leaves, curry powder, dried thyme, a large 
                pinch of salt, and a large pinch of black or white pepper. 
                Cook, stirring, until the mixture is fragrant and the onions soften 
                slightly, about 3 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Stir in tomato paste and 2 teaspoons (8g) butter. 
                Cook, stirring continuously, until the tomato paste darkens, 
                about 3 minutes. Stir in reserved stew base, cover partially with 
                the lid to prevent splattering, and cook at a gentle simmer over 
                medium-low heat until reduced by half, about 15 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Stir in stock and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                Season with salt and pepper; if the curry flavor is lacking, 
                you can add more to taste (the curry powder should come through pleasantly 
                but not be overpowering, though this is a question of personal taste).
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Stir in rice until evenly coated in sauce. 
                Cover the pot with a double piece of foil or parchment paper, 
                crimped down around the edges to seal, then top with lid 
                (this will trap steam to lock in the flavor and aid cooking). 
                Reduce the heat to the lowest possible and cook for 20 minutes, 
                then uncover pot and gently stir rice to redistribute. 
                Cover again and continue to cook until rice is just cooked through 
                but still retains a firm bite and the liquid is mostly absorbed, 
                about 15 minutes longer. If rice is undercooked and/or still wet, 
                cover and cook 5 minutes longer.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Stir in sliced tomato along with the remaining 
                sliced onion and the remaining 1 teaspoon (4g) 
                butter until butter is fully melted
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand 10 minutes. Serve.
            </p></li>
